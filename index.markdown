# Overview of Features

1. **Sophisticated Agent Workflows:**
   - **Divide Complex Processes into Tasks:** Superexpert.AI allows you to break down complex workflows, such as customer service, into discrete tasks for better efficiency and control.
   - **Flexible Task Transitions:** Agents can seamlessly move from task to task or always return to a central home task before determining the next step.
   - **Custom Instructions, Data, and Tools:** Each task operates independently with its own set of instructions, relevant data, and custom tools, enabling precise and context-aware responses.

2. **User-Friendly Form Interface**
   - **Create Agents without Writing Code:** Create agents using a simple form interface. Enter instructions, pick the model (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic), and you have a fully functional agent.

2. **Multi-Model Integration:**
   - **Diverse LLM Support:** Integrate leading language models, including OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic, selecting the optimal model for each task based on performance requirements and budget considerations.

3. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   - **Efficient Data Handling:** Manage extensive datasets by chunking large files into embeddings, creating searchable corpora, and associating them with specific agent tasks for precise information retrieval.

4. **Declarative Custom Tools:**
   - **Simplified Function Integration:** Develop custom functions using a declarative programming model, allowing agents to perform specialized actions without complex coding.

5. **Modern Web Application Architecture:**
   - **Cutting-Edge Technology Stack:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, Superexpert.AI leverages contemporary web frameworks to ensure scalability, performance, and developer-friendly customization.


# FAQ


**1. How much does Superexpert.AI cost?**

The platform is open source (MIT license). You can download from [https://github.com/superexpert/superexpert-ai](https://github.com/superexpert/superexpert-ai) for free. 

**2. What types of applications can I build with Superexpert.AI?**

You can build anything from a simple chatbot to a sophisticated AI Agent that can perform hundreds of distinct tasks. For example, you can use Superexpert.AI to build Customer Service Agents, Knowledge Discovery Tools, Employee Onboarding Systems, and Process Automation Solutions. 

**3. Can I create custom agents without writing code?**

Yes. The Superexpert.AI platform uses a friendly form interface to enable you to configure agents and tasks. You
can build sophisticated AI solutions without writing a single line of code.

**4. I have complex needs. How easy is to extend the platform?**

The Superexpert.AI platform was designed to be extensible. You can easily add custom tools that load custom data for each task (for example, customer profiles) or execute custom functions (display a modal popup asking a customer to complete a form). Superexpert.AI supports a simple declarative method of making tools available to AI Agents that works across different AI providers.

**5. I need to build an AI Agent that can answer questions concerning information that is stored in hundreds of documents. Does Superexpert.AI support RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?**

Yes. You can upload documents and Superexpert.AI will chunk the documents and generate embeddings for you automatically.
