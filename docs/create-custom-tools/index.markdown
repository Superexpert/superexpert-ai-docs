*Walkthrough:** Learn how to create and use custom tools in Superexpert.AI.
- Step 1: Understand the different types of tools:
  - **Server Data Tools**: Load data from the server within a task.
  - **Server Tools**: Execute server-side functions, such as `getWeather()` or `updateCustomerProfile()`.
  - **Client Tools**: Execute client-side functions, such as triggering a modal confirmation.
- Step 2: Implement a simple tool and integrate it into an agent task.
- Step 3: Test and refine tool execution within an agent workflow.
