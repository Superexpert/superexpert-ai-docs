# Overview of Features

1. **Sophisticated Agent Workflows:**
   - **Divide Complex Processes into Tasks:** Superexpert.AI allows you to break down complex workflows, such as customer service, into discrete tasks for better efficiency and control.
   - **Flexible Task Transitions:** Agents can seamlessly move from task to task or always return to a central home task before determining the next step.
   - **Custom Instructions, Data, and Tools:** Each task operates independently with its own set of instructions, relevant data, and custom tools, enabling precise and context-aware responses.

2. **Multi-Model Integration:**
   - **Diverse LLM Support:** Integrate leading language models, including OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic, selecting the optimal model for each task based on performance requirements and budget considerations.

3. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   - **Efficient Data Handling:** Manage extensive datasets by chunking large files into embeddings, creating searchable corpora, and associating them with specific agent tasks for precise information retrieval.

4. **Declarative Custom Tools:**
   - **Simplified Function Integration:** Develop custom functions using a declarative programming model, allowing agents to perform specialized actions without complex coding.

5. **Modern Web Application Architecture:**
   - **Cutting-Edge Technology Stack:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, Superexpert.AI leverages contemporary web frameworks to ensure scalability, performance, and developer-friendly customization.
