# 99Designs Competition -Superexpert.AI Website


## Background Context

Superexpert.AI is an open source platform for building AI agents. Users can navigate to https://superexpert.ai (this website) to view the landing page and product documentation. This website should be friendly and professional.

## Technology

I use Tailwind for all styling for the Superexpert.AI website. 

## Color Palette

My preference is to stick with an orange color palette for both the Superexpert.AI platform and the Superexpert.AI website. See [https://superexpert.com/](https://superexpert.com/).

For syntax highighting, I can use any of these themes: https://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/ruby.html

## Responsiveness

The Superexpert website needs to work on both desktop and mobile.

## Terminology

* "Superexpert.AI" - The name of the platform should be a single word including ".AI".
* "Open Source" -- Not "Open-Source".
* "Platform" -- Superexpert.AI is a "platform" and not a "framework."

## Pages

I need designs for the following 2 pages:

### 1.Landing Page

* goal: This is the main landing page. I will be promoting this page everywhere. The goal is to drive downloads of the Superexpert.AI framework.
* location: [https://superexpert.ai](https://superexpert.ai)
* audience: The primary audience is enterpise software engineers with a secondary audience of business decision makers (Product Managers, VPs).
* inspiration: https://www.langchain.com/langgraph,  https://anythingllm.com/, https://www.restack.io/
* notes:
    * Please build on the existing content of the page at [https://superexpert.ai](https://superexpert.ai).

### 2.Install In Minutes

* goal: This is a step-by-step walkthrough of how users can install the platform. I will use the design for this page as the template for all of the other walkthroughs (for example, Quick Start, Create Attachments, Deploy to Production, etc.) The experience should be friendly.
* location: [https://superexpert.ai/docs/install-in-minutes/](https://superexpert.ai/docs/install-in-minutes/)
