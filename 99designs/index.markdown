# 99Designs Competition


## Background Context

Superexpert.AI is an open source platform for building AI agents. I need to design two things:


1. The Superexpert.AI platform itself -- users can download the app from [GitHub](https://github.com/Superexpert/superexpert-ai){:target="_blank"} and run it locally. Alternatively, users can try out the app using the live demo at [demo.superexpert.ai](https://demo.superexpert.com){:target="_blank"}
2. The Superexpert.AI website -- Users can navigate to superexpert.ai (this website) to view the landing page and product documentation. This website should be friendly and professional.

## Technology

I use Tailwind for all styling for both the Superexpert.AI platform and the superexpert.ai website. 

## Color Palette

My preference is to stick with an orange color palette for both the Superexpert.AI platform and the Superexpert.AI website. See [https://superexpert.com/](https://superexpert.com/).

## Terminology

* "Superexpert.AI" - The name of the platform should be a single word including ".AI".
* "Open Source" -- Not "Open-Source".
* "Platform" -- Superexpert.AI is a "platform" and not a "framework."

## Pages

I need designs for the following 5 pages:

### 1.Landing Page

* goal: This is the main landing page. I will be promoting this page everywhere. The goal is to drive downloads of the Superexpert.AI framework.
* location: [https://superexpert.ai](https://superexpert.ai)
* audience: The primary audience is software engineers with a secondary audience of business decision makers (Product Managers, VPs).
* inspiration: https://www.langchain.com/langgraph,  https://anythingllm.com/, https://www.restack.io/

### 2.Install In Minutes

* goal: This is a step-by-step walkthrough of how users can install the platform. I will use the design for this page as the template for all of the other walkthroughs (for example, Quick Start, Create Attachments, Deploy to Production, etc.) The experience should be friendly.
* location: [https://superexpert.ai/docs/install-in-minutes/](https://superexpert.ai/docs/install-in-minutes/)
* audience: The audience is software engineers.
